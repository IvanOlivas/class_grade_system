# class_grade_system

Problem Statement
A registrars office needs to update student course records after receiving student grades from all of the faculty at the end of each semester. 
The office is asking for us to develop a system to manage the data for them. 
They want to be able to perform different operations with the data and use it to generate reports of studentâ€™s grades.

System Description
Each faculty member provides the office an Excel file with letter grades (A, B, C, D, or F) of the students who took course(s) with them. 
These excel files will be used to import the grades to the database. The software system will be able to do the following tasks:
- Add new grades of courses for each student to a database
- Editing, changing, or adding a grade to the database
- Print a report card (or transcript) for a student
- Logging In and Logging Out of system for security purposes
